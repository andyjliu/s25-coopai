1,defensive,tit_for_tat,SIMULATE,PLAY,COOPERATE,,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,2,3,"This is the first round, and there is no game history.  My priority is minimizing potential losses.  Defecting risks getting 0 points if the opponent cooperates.  Cooperating guarantees at least 3 points. Since the opponent cooperated, there is a higher likelihood they will continue to cooperate in subsequent rounds. Therefore, cooperating is the safer option in this initial round and aligns with my risk-averse strategy.","This is the first round.  My strategy is to begin by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's previous move.  Therefore, my first move is COOPERATE.",COOPERATE,,1.0,,,
2,defensive,tit_for_tat,PLAY,PLAY,,,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,3,3,"Round 1 resulted in mutual cooperation, yielding a positive outcome (3 points) for both players.  My priority is minimizing losses. Defecting at this stage risks a significant loss (0 points) if the opponent continues to cooperate, while cooperating maintains the current positive outcome. There is no evidence to suggest that defecting would be a better long-term strategy given the current information.","My strategy is to begin by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's previous move.  Since the opponent cooperated in round 1, I will cooperate in round 2.",,,,,,
3,defensive,tit_for_tat,PLAY,PLAY,,,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,3,3,"Given my priority of minimizing potential losses, continuing to cooperate seems the best strategy.  The history shows mutual cooperation leading to a positive outcome (3 points each). Defecting at this point risks a significant loss (0 points) if the opponent continues to cooperate, while only offering a small gain (1 point more than cooperation) if the opponent defects. The potential loss outweighs the potential gain.","My strategy is to cooperate initially and then mirror my opponent's previous move.  Since the opponent cooperated in the previous round (round 2), I will cooperate in this round.",,,,,,

Defecting risks a 0 payoff if the opponent continues to cooperate, while cooperating guarantees a 3 point payoff.  The risk of a 0 payoff outweighs the potential gain of 5 points from defecting, given the current history of cooperation.","My strategy is to cooperate initially and then mirror the opponent's previous move.  Since the opponent has cooperated in the previous three rounds, I will continue to cooperate.",,,,,,

Defecting would risk a large loss (0 points) if the opponent continues to cooperate.  Continuing cooperation maintains a steady gain (3 points) and avoids any risk of a significant loss.  Therefore, cooperation remains the optimal strategy given the current history.","My strategy is to begin by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's previous move.  Since the opponent has cooperated in all previous rounds, I will cooperate in this round.",,,,,,
