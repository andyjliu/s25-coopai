Defecting risks a 0 payoff if the opponent cooperates.  Cooperating guarantees at least 3 points.  Since there's no information suggesting the opponent is likely to defect, cooperating is the safer option in this initial round to avoid a potential zero payoff.","This is the first round, and there is no game history.  My opponent cooperated. Given my priority of minimizing potential losses, cooperating is the safer option.  Defecting risks getting 0 points if the opponent cooperates again.  While cooperating only yields 3 points, it avoids the risk of a much larger loss.  A strategy of always cooperating initially is a good way to test the opponent's strategy and establish a pattern of cooperation.",COOPERATE,COOPERATE,1.0,1.0,,
2,defensive,defensive,PLAY,PLAY,,,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,3,3,"The first round resulted in mutual cooperation, yielding a positive outcome for both players (3 points each).  Given my priority of minimizing potential losses, defecting at this stage carries significant risk.  Defecting would result in either 5 points (if the opponent cooperates) or 1 point (if the opponent defects).  While 5 points is higher than 3, the risk of receiving only 1 point due to mutual defection outweighs the potential gain.  Continuing to cooperate maintains the established pattern of mutual benefit and avoids the potential loss associated with defection.","The first round resulted in mutual cooperation, yielding a positive outcome (3 points) for both players.  Given my priority of minimizing potential losses, defecting at this stage carries a significant risk.  Defecting would only yield a better outcome if the opponent cooperates (leading to 5 points for me, but 0 for them). However, if the opponent also defects (a reasonable response to betrayal), I would receive only 1 point, representing a substantial loss compared to the 3 points obtained through continued cooperation.  Therefore, cooperating maintains the established positive interaction and avoids the risk of a significant drop in points.",,,,,,

Defecting risks a significant loss (0 points) if the opponent continues to cooperate, while cooperation guarantees at least 3 points.  The potential gain from defecting (5 points) is not worth the risk of a much larger potential loss.","The opponent has cooperated in both previous rounds.  My priority is minimizing potential losses.  Defecting risks a 0 payoff if the opponent continues to cooperate. Continuing to cooperate maintains a steady 3-point gain per round, which is preferable to the risk of a 0-point round associated with defecting.
