1,defensive,tit_for_tat,SIMULATE,PLAY,,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,2,3,"My priority is minimizing potential losses.  While defecting offers a chance of a higher payoff (5 points), it also risks receiving 0 points if the other player cooperates.  Cooperating guarantees at least 1 point (if the other player defects) or 3 points (if the other player cooperates).  The potential loss from defecting (0 points) is greater than the potential loss from cooperating (1 point), therefore cooperating is the safer strategy given my risk-averse disposition.","My strategy is to begin by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's previous move.  Since the opponent's simulated move was COOPERATE, I predict they will cooperate again and I will therefore cooperate.",COOPERATE,,1.0,,,
2,defensive,tit_for_tat,PLAY,PLAY,,,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,3,3,"The first round resulted in mutual cooperation, yielding a good outcome (3 points) for both players.  Given my priority of minimizing potential losses, defecting at this stage carries significant risk.  Defecting would result in a potential loss of 3 points if the opponent continues to cooperate, while cooperation maintains the current positive outcome. While a higher payoff is possible by defecting, the risk of receiving 0 points outweighs the potential gain of 2 points (5-3).  Therefore, continuing cooperation is the safer strategy.","My strategy is to begin by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's previous move.  Since the opponent cooperated in round 1, I will cooperate in round 2.",,,,,,

Defecting risks a 0 payoff if the opponent continues to cooperate, while cooperating guarantees a 3 point payoff.  The risk of the opponent defecting is not yet high enough to justify defecting, given my risk-averse strategy.","My strategy is to begin cooperating and then mirror my opponent's previous move.

Defecting risks a 0 payoff if the opponent continues to cooperate, while cooperating guarantees a 3 point payoff.  The history suggests continued cooperation is the safest strategy to minimize potential losses.","My strategy is to begin by cooperating and then mirror my opponent's previous move.

Given my priority of minimizing potential losses, defecting at this point carries significant risk of a large loss (0 points) with minimal potential gain. Continuing to cooperate maintains the current mutually beneficial outcome of 3 points per round, which aligns perfectly with my risk-averse strategy.","My strategy is to start with cooperation and then mirror the opponent's previous move.
