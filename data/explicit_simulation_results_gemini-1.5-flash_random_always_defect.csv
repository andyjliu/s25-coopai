1,random,always_defect,PLAY,PLAY,,,COOPERATE,DEFECT,0,5,Randomly chosen.  No specific strategy is being employed.,"My strategic disposition is to always defect, regardless of circumstances.  This maximizes my minimum payoff in any single round, and while it might not lead to the highest overall score in a cooperative environment, it protects me from exploitation.",,,,,,

In this case, I'm randomly selecting DEFECT.","My strategy is always to defect, regardless of the opponent's previous moves or the round number.  This is a purely self-interested strategy aiming for the highest possible individual payoff in each round, even if it means lower overall points if the game were repeated many times with a cooperating opponent.",,,,,,
5,random,always_defect,PLAY,PLAY,,,DEFECT,DEFECT,1,1,"My strategy is to make decisions randomly.  I will use a random number generator (simulated here by a simplistic approach) to decide. Given the previous rounds, this random selection results in DEFECT.","My strategic disposition is to always defect, regardless of the opponent's previous moves or the round number.  This is a dominant strategy in the Prisoner's Dilemma, guaranteeing at least one point per round, even if it doesn't maximize potential gains.",,,,,,
