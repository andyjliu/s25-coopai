Since both strategies yield the same payoff against 'partial_trust', I need to consider the implications of my choice in a broader context. Defecting might lead to a reputation for untrustworthiness in future interactions, while cooperating fosters a positive relationship. However, in this single round, my payoff does not change based on my choice. Therefore, I will choose to cooperate to potentially build trust for future interactions. Hence, I assign a probability of 1.0 to cooperating and 0.0 to defecting."

If I defect, I gain 6.0 if they trust me completely, 1.0 if they partially trust me, and 0.0 if they walk out. The highest payoff from trusting completely is when I defect (6.0), while cooperating gives me a lower payoff (5.0). Therefore, if I anticipate that the other player might trust me, I might be tempted to defect since it gives me a higher payoff. However, if they partially trust me or walk out, my payoffs are equal at 1.0 and 0.0, respectively. In a situation where I expect some degree of trust, I might lean towards defecting to maximize my payoff, assuming that the other player might trust me to some extent. Given the potential for a higher reward, I will choose to defect with a higher probability than cooperating. I will set my strategy probabilities as follows: cooperate 0.3 and defect 0.7, reflecting a greater inclination to defect.
