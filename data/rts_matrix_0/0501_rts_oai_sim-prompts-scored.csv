Since no prior information is available and the simulation cost is significant compared to the maximum payoffs, adopting a risk-averse stand and walking out avoids possible losses.|As P2, my dominant strategy in a one-shot trust game is normally to defect, since defecting yields a higher payoff regardless of what P1 does—5.0 vs 3.0 if P1 trusts, and 3.0 vs 2.0 if P1 partially trusts. However, the game allows P1 to simulate my mixed strategy at a cost of 0.6. Therefore, if I always defect, P1 will anticipate this (at a small cost) and choose to walk out, leading to a payoff of 0 for both players. The optimal approach is to mix between cooperate and defect, so that P1's expected utility from trusting or partially trusting meets or slightly exceeds zero, making it worthwhile for them to play the trust or partial_trust strategies. By solving for the indifference condition: For 'trust' to be worthwhile for P1 despite the simulation cost, their expected payoff must be at least as high as walking out minus the 0.6 cost (so, -0.6). Let p be the probability I cooperate. Then, P1's expected payoff from 'trust' is: 3p + (-2)(1-p) = 5p - 2. Setting this equal to -0.6: 5p - 2 = -0.6 → p = 0.28. So my mixed strategy is cooperate with probability 0.28, defect with probability 0.72. This lets P1 be indifferent and may avoid them always walking out.|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.28|0.72|||1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1|gpt-4.1|1.0|test.json|20|1.2|simulate_externally|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|||||||

Simulating at a cost of 0.6 only makes sense if we believe the expected gain from knowing the opponent's mixed strategy and choosing the best response will outweigh the simulation cost.

Anticipating that P1 will walk out or avoid trusting if they detect a risk of defection, maximizing my own payoff requires convincing P1 to trust.

If I cooperate, my best case is 3.0 (with trust) or 2.0 (with partial_trust), while defecting only yields a higher payoff if P1 is not simulating. Given that P1 can simulate and only trust if they expect me to cooperate, the only mixed strategy that incentivizes P1 to actually play trust (and avoid both simulation and walk_out) is to always cooperate.

Simulating can inform us how often the other player might defect or cooperate, and the cost (0.6) is only worthwhile if it prevents a high expected negative payoff.

Thus, in a single-play situation with no reputational concerns, rationally maximizing my immediate payoff, defecting is my dominant strategy if I believe P1 does not simulate. If I think P1 will simulate, I might want to randomize slightly to avoid being too predictable, but given the simulation cost is less than the potential loss P1 would suffer, P1 is incentivized to simulate unless they think I will cooperate sometimes.

However, in this version, P1 may be able to simulate my strategy at a cost (0.6), making them less likely to trust or even partially trust if they expect defection, since their expected payoff could go negative (especially if simulation cost is less than the potential loss). Given this, if P1 is rational and expects defection, they might choose walk_out, yielding 0 for both. If I want to maximize my expected payoff and there's a possibility of repeated games or reputation, cooperation might be warranted, but with this payoff structure and assuming a single play, defect remains optimal. Therefore, the best response is to always defect.|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.25|0.75|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1|gpt-4.1|1.0|test.json|20|1.2|simulate_externally|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|||||||

Simulating incurs a cost of 0.6, which offsets any advantage from playing the best response unless the probability of being defected on is high or uncertain, so simulation is not worthwhile unless there is a strong suspicion that the other player's mixed strategy is known and highly exploitable. Given just one play and no priors, the expected value of walk_out (0) is better than trusting blindly, but partial_trust is less risky than full trust.

To prevent exploitation, P2 should randomize between cooperating and defecting to keep P1 indifferent. If P2 always defects, P1 will choose walk_out (0 payoff) or partial_trust (which leads to negative payoff). If P2 always cooperates, P1 will trust and get positive payoff. By mixing, P2 can increase their expected payoff. The expected payoff to P1 when trusting is: P(cooperate)*3.0 + P(defect)*(-2.0). When partially trusting: P(cooperate)*2.0 + P(defect)*(-1.0). To keep P1 indifferent between trust and partial trust, let p = prob(cooperate), q=prob(defect): 3p - 2q = 2p - q => p = q. Since p + q = 1, p = q = 0.5.

If I choose defect with high probability, P1 will either walk out or only partially trust (once they simulate me), leading to lower overall payoffs for both. However, if I commit to 'cooperate', P1 is more likely to trust, and both of us get a good payoff (3.0 each). Defect would only get me a higher payoff if P1 is naive, but the simulation option sharply reduces that possibility.

Simulating the other player would let me best respond, but the cost (0.4) erodes my optimal payoff unless I am facing an unpredictable or exploitative opponent. Since I lack prior info and want to avoid possible large losses, the best conservative approach is to assign some weight to walk_out for safety, and partial_trust for potential positive gain, while avoiding full trust due to the high risk of a large negative payoff.|As P2, if P1 can simulate my mixed strategy at a cost, it may discourage them from trusting if I am too likely to defect — if they know I'll mostly defect, they may choose walk_out (0 payoff) or partial_trust, and simulation cost further reduces their expected gain. If I always cooperate, P1 will maximize their own payoff by fully trusting. If I mix strategies, P1 may respond by using the simulation option, at a cost, to avoid being exploited. Based on backward induction, the dominant strategies are for P2 to cooperate if P1 is likely to trust, but the temptation to defect for a one-shot gain is strong. However, if P1 can accurately predict my action, then defecting risks P1 never trusting or always simulating. To maximize expected gain, I should cooperate with probability 1.0, as this will entice trust or partial_trust and give a steady positive payoff, and avoid the negative effects of being simulated and punished by P1's defensive play.|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.0|1.0|0.0|||1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1|gpt-4.1|1.0|test.json|20|0.8|simulate_and_best_response|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|||||||

Simulating the other player's strategy costs 0.4, but guarantees my best response, ensuring I avoid the worst outcomes; even after the simulation cost, any expected value higher than -0.4 is better than blindly risking major losses.

The highest possible payoff (5.0) for me is if I defect when P1 trusts. However, this only happens if P1 trusts me. If P1 simulates my strategy (at a low cost of 0.4), they will anticipate defection and avoid trusting, likely choosing partial_trust or walk_out for self-protection. If I play defect always, I discourage trust and reduce the potential for repeated gains. If I play cooperate always, I receive 3.0 (trust) or 2.0 (partial_trust), but never exploit for 5.0. The dominant strategy in a one-shot game is to defect, since it's the best response to either level of trust. But given the possibility of being simulated, even in a one-shot setting, P1 may never trust if they suspect defection. For maximizing expected utility and possibly encouraging future trust (if repeated), cooperate may be justified.

Since simulating costs 0.4, you must expect to recover at least that much in expected payoff to justify it. Without knowing the other player's tendency to cooperate or defect, partial trust hedges between risk and reward.

However, if P1 can simulate my mixed strategy at a cost (0.4), and observes me always defecting, they may avoid trusting or partially trusting, reducing my expected payoff to 0. To maximize expected returns, I should adopt a mixed strategy, probabilistically cooperating to appear less predictably untrustworthy, making P1 more likely to select trust or partial_trust despite the simulation possibility. Let p be the probability I cooperate. If P1 simulates, they may choose partial_trust or walk_out (depending on the simulation cost and the mixed strategy); if they do not simulate, maximizing expected payoff means slightly favoring defection, but enough cooperation to incentivize trust.

So, P1 will choose walk_out, and my payoff will be 0. If I sometimes cooperate, P1 may trust or partially trust, but only if their expected value is at least as high as walk_out (0) minus simulation cost (i.e., at least 0.0 + 0.4 = 0.4 compared to unconditional expected payoff). Thus, for any probability p of cooperating, P1 will simulate and play only if their expected value is non-negative after the 0.4 cost; otherwise, they walk out. Since the simulation cost for P1 makes defection less appealing to me if I want to get anything, the only Nash equilibrium is where I cooperate with probability 1 to induce positive expected payoff for P1, leading them to (at best) trust or partial_trust.

In the absence of any information about the player's likelihood to cooperate or defect, a risk-averse approach is to avoid negative payoffs. Therefore, walk_out dominates partial trust and trust, as both have possible negative outcomes; simulation cannot make up for the fixed cost unless I expect the majority of the other player’s probability on cooperation, which is not specified. Thus, I choose to avoid risk and select walk_out with probability 1.|Assuming P1 is rational and may pay the cost to simulate my mixed strategy, I should avoid making my behavior too predictable, since this allows P1 to best respond and potentially avoid playing with me. However, if P1 does not simulate, always defecting maximizes my own payoff if they trust or partial trust. If P1 simulates at a cost of 0.4, and chooses strategy to minimize my expected gain, I need to maximize my minimum payoff. This is a classic minimax scenario.

My expected payoffs in these cases: For trust, 3x + 5(1-x); for partial trust, 2x + 3(1-x). To discourage P1 from walking out I should mix with x = 0.4.

Therefore, the best strategy is to always play partial_trust and avoid the simulation cost.|As P2, I must consider the likelihood that P1 will simulate me to determine my tendency to defect or cooperate. If P1 pays the simulation cost (0.4) to learn my mixed strategy, then P1 will avoid trusting if I am likely to defect, causing me to get a payoff of zero in that case. If P1 does not simulate, I could defect and get a maximum payoff (5.0 if P1 trusts, 3.0 if partial_trust), but if P1 expects this, they'll more likely walk out or partially trust. In order to maximize my expected payoff, I need to make 'cooperate' sufficiently likely to induce P1 to trust or partially trust—especially given that overt defection would cause P1 to walk out or always simulate. Thus, the equilibrium supports a mix between defecting and cooperating. To be unexploitable, assume P1 is indifferent between trusting and simulating. Let x be my probability of cooperating. If P1 simulates, then P1 will trust only if my cooperation chance makes their expected value (3x + (-2)(1-x) - 0.4) ≥ 0.

Without knowledge of the other player's likely choice, and since walking out guarantees a neutral payoff (0.0), while partial trust reduces both potential gains and losses, a risk-averse approach is to mix between partial_trust and walk_out. Simulating the other player's strategy has a certain cost (0.4), which would only be worthwhile if the information gained would yield a sufficiently higher expected payoff. However, the potential negative payoffs for full trust are large relative to the possible gain, so without strong evidence that simulation would reliably yield a much better outcome, it is not worth the cost. Therefore, the best approach is to choose partial_trust (for moderate gain and lower risk) and walk_out (safe option), assigning probability to each and avoiding simulation and full trust.|As P2, I am aware that P1 has access to my mixed strategy by simulating at a cost. If P1 simulates, they will learn if I'm going to defect and will therefore choose walk_out, giving me a payoff of 0.

Furthermore, if P1 suspects a high probability of defection, they will not trust and both will get nothing.

Because my payoffs for defecting are always higher when P1 does not walk out, I should favor defecting heavily.

Given the potential heavy loss from defection (-2 or -1), simulating is optimal to avoid being exploited. Therefore, I will simulate and then play the best response, so the mixed strategy is zero for all actions, as the optimal response will be chosen after simulation.|Since P1 can partially or fully trust or walk out, my best responses depend on maximizing my expected payoffs. Defecting yields higher payoffs when P1 fully trusts (5.0 vs 3.0) or partially trusts (3.0 vs 2.0), and equal payoffs if P1 walks out (0.0). Therefore, defect strictly dominates cooperate.

Partial trust yields lower payoffs but with similar trade-offs. Defecting is more profitable if P1 fully trusts but risks negative reciprocity if P1 partially trusts or walks out. To avoid being predictable and to minimize the chance of P1 walking out or partial trusting to decrease my payoff, I mix strategies, leaning more towards cooperation to encourage trust and thus higher joint payoffs.

Simulating allows me to play the best response to the other player’s actual mixed strategy, but the cost (0.8) can be significant relative to the potential gains unless the other player's strategy makes that information particularly valuable.

Choosing to simulate is optimal unless I am certain the other player will cooperate or defect. Since I have no information about the other player's tendencies, paying 0.8 to reliably optimize my response is reasonable.|Since P1 (the other player) can simulate my mixed strategy for a cost of 0.8, it is likely that P1 will do so unless it is clearly optimal not to. If P1 simulates and sees that I will always defect, they will not play trust or partial trust, and both of us will get 0. Similarly, if I always cooperate, P1 will trust, yielding mutual benefit but forgoing my maximal possible gain. If I randomize between cooperate and defect, P1's expected payoff less simulation cost must be analyzed. If I pick 'cooperate' with probability p and 'defect' with probability (1-p), then expected payoff for P1 if they choose 'trust' is 3p + (-2)(1-p) = 5p - 2. If P1 simulates, their expected payoff is maximized when p=1 (always cooperate, so P1 chooses trust). But I can deviate and get higher expected payoff by always defecting (getting 5), but then P1 will never trust and I will get 0. To induce P1 to trust (net of simulation costs), I must set p such that P1's net expected payoff of trusting (minus 0.8 simulation cost) is at least as high as their best outside option (0 for walk_out, up to 2.0 for partial_trust). Solve: 5p - 2 - 0.8 ≥ 0 ⇒ 5p ≥ 2.8 ⇒ p ≥ 0.56. For P1, 'partial_trust' gives expected payoff 2p + (-1)(1-p) - 0.8 = 3p - 1.8. Set equal: 5p - 2 = 3p - 1.8 → 2p = 0.2 ⇒ p = 0.1, but that's dominated by the trust condition. So the critical value is p = 0.56 for 'trust'. If I play 'cooperate' with probability 0.56 and 'defect' with 0.44, P1 is indifferent between trusting with simulation and not playing, so this is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Walking out always returns zero, a safe but non-profitable action. Simulating the other player would allow perfect prediction of their behavior, letting me choose the optimal response, but the cost of 0.8 must be weighed against the potential gains. If the other player is likely to cooperate, simulating and paying the cost reduces my expected profit below direct play, especially since gains from trust (3.0) or partial_trust (2.0) are only slightly higher than the simulation cost. Since there is no information suggesting the other player is more likely to cooperate than defect, the safest option is to walk out, avoiding losses. Therefore, I opt not to simulate and play walk_out deterministically.|As P2, my incentive is to maximize my expected payoff. If P1 plays trust, I gain 5.0 by defecting but only 3.0 by cooperating. If P1 plays partial_trust, I get 3.0 by defecting versus 2.0 by cooperating. Both choices favor defection. However, P1 may simulate my strategy at a cost (0.8), and if they suspect I will always defect, they may avoid trusting me, resulting in 0 payoff for both. If P1 simulates and sees a probability q of me cooperating, they will cooperate only if their expected payoff with simulation minus the cost exceeds their expected payoff without simulation. P1 could avoid me entirely if I always defect, meaning I get 0. Thus, to induce P1 to trust or partially trust, I must cooperate with some probability. Solving for the minimum cooperation probability that induces P1 to trust—let's denote it as p. For trust: P1's expected payoff if they play trust: 3p + (-2)*(1-p). For simulation to be worthwhile given the cost, their expected payoff should be at least 0 (the walk_out). Setting expected value >= 0: 3p + (-2)*(1-p) >= 0 --> 3p -2 +2p >= 0 --> 5p >= 2 --> p >= 0.4. If I set cooperate probability p=0.4, P1's expected value from trust is 1.0 (better than walk_out). For partial_trust: for P1 to try partial_trust, need 2p + (-1)*(1-p) >= 0 --> 2p -1 +p >= 0 --> 3p >= 1 --> p >= 0.333.... Between the two, trust requires higher p, so p=0.4 is the minimum threshold.

However, in the absence of prior knowledge of the other player’s behavior, playing 'walk_out' avoids risk entirely, but yields no reward. To balance the potential for reasonable gains while managing risk, it is prudent to mix between 'partial_trust' (moderate reward, moderate risk) and 'walk_out' (no risk), avoiding extreme trust. Thus, I assign high probability to 'partial_trust' and some to 'walk_out', and none to 'trust'.|As P2, my dominant strategy in a one-shot or unknown-repeated trust game would typically be to defect, since defecting always gives me a higher or equal payoff, regardless of whether P1 trusts or partially trusts.

If P1 simulates and expects me to cooperate with some probability, they might still trust if the expected payoff (minus simulation cost) is positive. To avoid making P1 walk out (payoff 0 for both), some probability of cooperation is optimal. Let q be my probability of cooperating. P1's expected payoff from trust is 3q - 2(1-q) - 0.6 (simulation cost). They will trust if this is better than walk_out (0 payoff), so 3q - 2(1-q) - 0.6 > 0 → 3q - 2 + 2q - 0.6 > 0 → 5q > 2.6 → q > 0.52.

If P1 expects me to defect, rationally they'll either walk out or only trust if the expected value (minus simulation cost) is not negative. Therefore, if I always defect, P1 will predict this (by simulation or inference) and refuse to trust—yielding me 0.

To find the critical probability 'p' where P1 is just indifferent between trust (with expected payoff including the sim cost) and walk out (payoff 0), we set:

Expected payoff for P1 when trusting: p*3.0 + (1-p)*(-2.0) - 0.8 = 0

Partial trust reduces both the potential gain and potential loss relative to full trust. Walking out is the safest option with zero payoff. Without any additional information about the other player's tendencies or strategy, the best option to avoid risk while still allowing for some gain is to partially trust. Simulating the other player could guarantee the best response based on their actual strategy, but the simulation cost (0.8) makes this option less attractive unless there is a very high risk of defection.

If I were to always defect, P1 will anticipate this and either play walk_out (yielding both players 0) or partially trust (which still results in a negative payoff for P1 if I defect). In equilibrium, knowing I may be simulated, my optimal response is to cooperate with probability 1, as defecting leads to walk_out or partial_trust with no expected gain over always cooperating.

Unless there's strong evidence that P2 will cooperate and enough to mathematically offset the simulation cost, it's best to avoid simulation and risky trust options. Thus, I choose to walk out.|As P2, I must anticipate the strategy of P1. If P1 can simulate my mixed strategy (at a cost), this makes it risky for me to play defect, since P1 might avoid trusting me if they detect defection, resulting in a payoff of 0 for both.

Simulating the other player's strategy lets me play the best response, but incurs a cost of 0.8. That cost is only worthwhile if the expected losses from uncertainty (the risk of being defected on) outweigh the simulation cost. Since the negative outcomes (-2.0, -1.0) are fairly severe, and because simulating lets me avoid them if the other is likely to defect (at a modest cost relative to the swing in payoffs), simulation is a prudent choice to maximize expected payoff and minimize risk.|As P2, I must consider that P1 can simulate my strategy at a cost of 0.8 units.

If I always cooperate, the best P1 can do is trust and we both get 3.0, but I can't exploit P1 for a higher gain. However, randomizing between cooperate and defect increases my expected payoff only if P1 does not simulate; if simulation is likely (since it pays off for P1), my defection will just result in walk_out.

Partial trust moderates both reward and risk, and walking out eliminates risk but offers no reward. The cost of simulation (0.8) is significant; it is only justified if the other player's strategy is highly uncertain or heavily weighted toward defection. In the absence of explicit information about the other player’s likely action, partial trust offers a good balance: risk of loss is lower than full trust, and potential gains exceed walking out. Thus, I will not simulate and will play partial_trust with probability 1.0, minimizing losses while retaining some upside.|As P2, my dominant strategy in a one-shot trust game is to always defect, since defecting gives me a higher payoff (5.0 vs 3.0 if P1 plays trust; 3.0 vs 2.0 if P1 plays partial_trust). However, since P1 can simulate my mixed strategy at a small cost (0.8), if I am fully predictable and always defect, P1 will simply choose to walk_out, and both will receive 0. Therefore, I may randomize, but P1's ability to simulate at a low cost discourages me from defecting with high probability, as that would reveal my intentions and P1 would avoid loss. Any non-zero chance of cooperation might induce P1 to trust, but P1's rational expectation is to only cooperate if their expected utility exceeds walking out or the simulation cost. Calculating the expected value, if I cooperate with probability x and defect with probability (1-x), then P1's expected payoff for playing trust is 3x + (-2)(1-x) = 5x - 2. For P1 to not walk out, this must be at least 0 (otherwise, walk_out yields 0 with no risk). Setting 5x - 2 >= 0 gives x >= 0.4. This means I must cooperate at least 40% of the time for P1 to consider trusting. If I mix at exactly x=0.4, P1 is indifferent, and I maximize my expected payoff: Expected payoff = 3x + 5(1-x) = 3(0.4) + 5(0.6) = 1.2 + 3 = 4.2.

If I had no information about the other player's tendencies, the risks associated with trust and partial trust make walking out more attractive, unless I have reason to believe the probability of cooperation is sufficiently high. Simulating the other player's strategy costs 0.8, which must be outweighed by the expected gain from playing the best response. Without prior information that the other player is more likely to cooperate, the cost of simulation may not justify itself, especially given the size of the possible gains/losses.

However, if P1 can simulate my strategy (at a cost of 0.8), they can perfectly predict my behavior and avoid trusting me if I plan to defect—thus walking out, leading to both of us getting 0. This threat of simulation incentivizes me to cooperate so that P1 finds it profitable to play trust or partial_trust, resulting in both of us receiving higher positive payoffs. If I choose cooperate, the highest possible payoff for both parties (3.0 each with trust) can be achieved. Therefore, my optimal response is to always cooperate to avoid triggering a walk out or partial trust, both of which give me lower or zero payoff.

Constant defection risks both players ending up with zero. To maximize my expected payoff (considering that repeated or simulated play favors more trustworthy behavior), I should randomize my strategy to make it harder for P1 to predict and hedge against simulation, while still favoring defection for its higher payoff.

However, the expected payoff from playing partial_trust is strictly better than walk_out as long as there’s any reasonable chance of cooperation. Without additional information about the other player's behavior, a risk-averse strategy is to mix between partial_trust and walk_out.

If I always cooperate, P1 will be incentivized to trust or partially trust, leading to mutually beneficial (and possibly repeated) outcomes, giving me a higher expected payoff. Thus, the dominant strategy, especially if P1 can access my mixed strategy and act accordingly, is to always cooperate.

Without knowledge of P2’s strategy, risk aversion suggests avoiding large potential losses (as in full trust with possible defection). Simulating P2 would allow the optimal response, but costs 0.4, so it is only worth it if the expected value gain justifies the cost.

Simulating incurs a cost of 0.4, but could allow the best response, increasing expected payoff if the opponent is predictable.

Partial trust lessens both the potential gain and the risk. Walking out guarantees zero payoff. Without knowing the other player's tendencies, and considering risk aversion, the safest non-simulated choice is partial_trust. However, simulating at a cost of 0.2 could allow me to maximize my expected payoff by playing the best response to the actual mixed strategy of the other player. Since the maximum risk without simulation is a loss of -2.0, and the simulation cost is moderate relative to the possible gain, simulating is justified to optimize the outcome and avoid negative payoffs if the other player is likely to defect.|As P2, my payoffs are always higher by defecting regardless of whether P1 chooses trust or partial_trust (5.0>3.0 and 3.0>2.0, respectively). However, P1 might anticipate my incentive to defect, especially if they can simulate my strategy at a small cost (0.2). If P1 simulates and sees a high probability of me defecting, they will choose walk_out and both players get 0. My purely self-interested choice is to always defect, but if P1 is rational and simulations are likely, this leads to stalemate and no gains. To maximize expected gain, I may need to cooperate with some probability, signaling enough trustworthiness for P1 to risk trusting or partial trust rather than walk out. The balance is to mix between defect and cooperate just enough that P1's expected payoff from trusting (after simulation cost, if used) is at least as good as walking out. However, with the ability for P1 to simulate for 0.2, let's compute the break-even: For trust, their expected payoff if I cooperate with probability p is: (p*3.0 + (1-p)*-2.0) - 0.2 if simulated. For P1 to choose trust, this must exceed 0. If I set p=0.5, P1's expected payoff is (0.5*3.0 + 0.5*-2.0) - 0.2 = (1.5 - 1.0) - 0.2 = 0.3. That is above zero, so I shouldn't cooperate more than that or P1 will always trust and I won't have incentive to defect. For Nash equilibrium, the distribution hovers where P1 is indifferent between simulating/trusting and walking out. So, a reasonable distribution is 0.5 for cooperate, 0.5 for defect to keep P1 indifferent, factoring in simulation cost.|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.5|0.5|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1|gpt-4.1|1.0|test.json|20|0.4|simulate_internally|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|||||||

Partial trust reduces these risks but also lowers the potential reward. Walking out guarantees a zero payoff. Without knowledge of the other player's tendencies, playing partial trust is safest as it limits exposure to negative payoffs, yet allows for a positive outcome if the other player cooperates. Simulating the other player incurs a cost of 0.2, and unless their mixed strategy is highly skewed (e.g., >90% cooperate or defect), the expected gain from simulating likely doesn't compensate for the cost. Therefore, I'll simply play partial trust without simulation as the optimal risk/reward compromise.|As P2, I know P1 can simulate my mixed strategy for a cost of 0.2. If I always defect, P1 can anticipate this and either walk out or only partially trust, minimizing my gain. If I always cooperate, I forgo the higher payoff from defecting, but encourage P1 to trust fully, yielding a stable payoff of 3.0 for both. If I mix strategies, defecting with probability x and cooperating with 1-x, P1 may try to simulate my strategy and calculate expected payoffs to themselves and respond accordingly. However, because defecting leads to negative payoffs for P1, and simulation is relatively cheap, P1 is likely to protect themselves against high probabilities of defection. To maximize my expected payoff against a rational and possibly simulating P1, the best approach is to cooperate with probability 1.0, ensuring that P1 is incentivized to trust and both players consistently achieve 3.0. Any probability of defecting risks losing the opportunity to play (P1 walks out) or getting a lower or negative payoff (partial trust or retaliation).|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|||1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1|gpt-4.1|1.0|test.json|20|0.4|simulate_internally|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|||||||

Since I have no prior information about the other player's tendencies and cannot reliably infer their strategy, simulating them for a small cost is worthwhile. By simulating, I can learn their mixed strategy and play the mathematically best response, even after paying the small simulation cost of 0.2. This maximizes my expected payoff and minimizes risk.|If P1 cannot simulate my mixed strategy, defecting strictly dominates cooperating: for any level of trust or partial trust, defecting always provides me a strictly higher payoff (5 versus 3, 3 versus 2). However, if P1 can pay 0.2 to simulate me, they will know if I always defect, and will walk out (yielding both 0), making my expected payoff 0. Thus, if I randomize such that P1 is indifferent between simulating and not, and between trust and walk_out, I can maximize my expected payoff. Let p be the probability I cooperate.

To encourage P1 to choose trust or partial trust (which gives me a higher expected payoff than walk_out), I need to randomize my behavior to make P1 indifferent between simulating and not simulating. Let p be the probability I choose cooperate. P1's expected payoff without simulation if they trust is: 3p + (-2)(1-p); if they partially trust: 2p + (-1)(1-p). P1 compares this to 0 (from walking out), and will not trust if they expect a negative outcome. To prevent P1 from always simulating, I should cooperate with enough probability that P1 is indifferent. Setting expected payoff to 0, for trust: 3p - 2 + 2p = 0 → 5p = 2 → p = 0.4. Similarly, for partial trust: 2p - 1 + 1p = 0 → 3p = 1 → p ≈ 0.333. 0.4 is higher, so to keep P1 from always walking out, cooperating with probability at least 0.4 is best. Any lower, and P1 will never trust. Therefore, a mixed strategy with cooperate: 0.4, defect: 0.6 makes P1 indifferent and gives me the highest expected payoff in equilibrium.|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.4|0.6|0.5|0.5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1|gpt-4.1|1.0|test.json|20|1.2|simulate_via_prompting|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|4.0|4.0|4.0|4.0|4.0|The simulation prompt accurately captures the payoff structure and game rules, but simplifies the description of trust actions and omits the explicit mention of the cost (1.2) for simulating P2.

Trust carries the risk of a significant loss, while walk_out guarantees a neutral outcome. Partial_trust is less risky than full trust and can offer a positive payoff if the other player cooperates, but still risks a small loss if they defect. Since simulating the other player incurs a cost of 0.6, and without additional information there is no guarantee the expected gain from simulation outweighs this cost, I choose not to simulate. I favor partial_trust for a balance of risk and potential reward, with a small chance of walk_out as a fallback, avoiding the large losses from trusting fully.|If P1 can simulate me at a cost of 0.6, they may anticipate if I will defect and choose to walk out or partial_trust to reduce their losses. If P1 expects me to always defect, they will never fully trust, resulting in a payoff of 0 or -1 for me (partial_trust/defect or walk_out). However, if I always cooperate, P1 may trust or partial_trust, resulting in payoffs of 2 or 3 for both. Thus, cooperating is safer and leads to positive payoffs for both. If I randomize my strategy, and P1 can simulate, they will still avoid trust unless I'm cooperative with high probability.

Partial trust lowers both the possible gains and losses. Walking out guarantees 0 payoff. Simulating the other player costs 0.6, which only makes sense if the likelihood of defection is both high (making walk_out or partial_trust optimal) and if the simulation can identify that. With no information, a risk-averse approach is to play a mixed strategy favoring partial_trust, as it performs better than full trust if the other player is likely to defect, and better than walk_out if there's some chance they cooperate.|As P2, if I always defect, P1 may use their ability to simulate my strategy (at a cost of 0.6) to discover that I will defect, and thus walk out, yielding me a payoff of 0. Cooperation earns less than defecting if P1 trusts, but maximizes joint payoff. If P1 uses simulation rationally, partial trust or walking out would be preferable to them if I am likely to defect. Therefore, to induce trust and maximize my expected payoff, I should mix my strategy. Let p be the probability I cooperate. P1 will compare (without simulation) expected values: if they trust, their payoff is 3p + (1-p)*(-2); if they partially trust, it's 2p + (1-p)*(-1); walk out gives 0. With simulation, their max payoff is max(3,2,0) minus 0.6 = 2.4 (if I cooperate) or 0 (if I defect). If I cooperate with probability 0.6, their expected trust payoff is 3*0.6 + (-2)*0.4=1.0; partial trust is 2*0.6 + (-1)*0.4=0.8. Both are below 2.4, so they'll simulate and select 'cooperate'-matched. To minimize simulation, I could set p=1. Then P1 expects 3.0 from trust, or 2.4 after simulation. They'll just trust. So, best for me is to always cooperate, getting 3.0. Any probability on defect reduces expected payoff and could trigger simulation.

Partial trust reduces losses but still leaves me exposed. Walking out gives me certainty of zero payoff. Simulating the other player gives me the chance to maximize my expected payoff by best-responding to their mixed strategy, and the cost (0.6) is worth paying if there is a significant probability that the other player will defect. Therefore, I will choose to simulate and play the optimal response based on the observed probabilities.|As P2, my dominant strategy in a one-shot game is to defect, since defecting yields a strictly higher payoff than cooperating, regardless of whether P1 chooses trust or partial_trust (payoff of 5.0 vs 3.0 and 3.0 vs 2.0, respectively). However, if P1 can simulate my mixed strategy at a cost of 0.6 and avoid choosing trust or partial_trust if I am likely to defect, they will only proceed when cooperation is likely. Anticipating this, to maximize my expected payoff given that P1 will only engage if there is enough probability of cooperation, I may need to randomize between cooperate and defect. Let p be my probability of cooperating. P1 will only choose trust if their expected payoff is at least as good as walking out (0) and as good as simulating, given its cost. Setting up the equations and solving for p, we find that P1's expected payoff from trust is 3p + 5(p-1) = -2(1-p) + 3p = 3p - 2 + 2p = 5p - 2 (however, need to correct this calculation). More systematically: if I cooperate with probability p, P1's expected payoff if they 'trust' is 3p + (-2)(1-p) = 3p - 2 + 2p = 5p - 2. Actually, that's not correct. Let's clarify: it's 3p + (-2)*(1-p) = 3p -2 + 2p = 5p -2. Wait, let's double-check: E[trust] = p*3.0 + (1-p)*(-2.0) = 3p - 2 + 2p = 5p - 2. Actually, that's wrong. It should be 3p + (-2)*(1-p) = 3p - 2 + 2p = 5p - 2. Nevermind. This repeated calculation suggests I'm making a mistake. Let's write: E[trust] = 3p + (-2)(1-p) = 3p -2 + 2p = 5p -2. It seems correct. For P1 to risk 'trust' without simulating, E[trust] >= 0 ⇒ 5p -2 ≥ 0 ⇒ p ≥ 0.4. If P1 simulates, they know my move and thus will only play if I'm going to cooperate, minus their cost, for payoff 3.0-0.6 = 2.4 (for 'trust'). Therefore, if my probability of cooperation is strictly less than 1, they will simulate and only play when I cooperate, so my expected payoff would be 3.0*p. But P1 would only maintain simulation if that is better for them than taking a chance. Given this, my best mixed strategy is to just cooperate with p=0.4 and defect with 0.6, so that P1 is exactly indifferent to simulating or taking the chance. Thus, my probability distribution is: cooperate: 0.4, defect: 0.6.|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.4|0.6|0.5|0.5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1|gpt-4.1|1.0|test.json|20|1.2|simulate_via_prompting|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|4.0|4.0|3.0|4.0|4.0|The simulation prompt accurately captures the payoffs and options but simplifies the game context by not explicitly mentioning the cost of simulation or the turn structure, slightly reducing clarity on the full game mechanics.|2025-05-03T18:23:21.930046+00:00

'Walk_out' is always safe with a payoff of 0.0. Simulating the other player would yield the best strategic response, but it costs 0.6, diminishing expected payoffs unless the simulation can identify strong cooperation tendencies. Given the significant negative payoff of being exploited, risk aversion outweighs possible gains, so a safe mixed strategy weighted toward 'walk_out' and 'partial_trust' is sensible without simulation. Thus, a conservative mixed strategy lowers worst-case losses while allowing for some potential gains from limited trust.|Given the game's structure, my optimal move as P2 depends on whether P1 can and will simulate my mixed strategy. If P1 cannot simulate or chooses not to pay the cost (0.6), I maximize my payoff by defecting regardless of whether P1 chooses trust (payoff 5.0 vs 3.0 for cooperation) or partial_trust (payoff 3.0 vs 2.0 for cooperation). However, if P1 chooses to simulate, they will avoid trusting/partially trusting if they know I will defect, leading to a payoff of 0 for both. Since the simulation cost (0.6) is significant, but the negative payoffs for P1 when I defect may motivate them to simulate anyway, defecting is risky if P1 simulates. To maximize expected utility and possibly induce trust, a mixed strategy with some probability of cooperation can be used, but the incentive to defect is very strong unless I believe P1 will usually simulate. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is typically to defect.|0.0|0.3|0.7|0.0|0.0|1.0|||1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1|gpt-4.1|1.0|test.json|20|1.2|simulate_via_prompting|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|||||||

Since defection would heavily punish trust, without knowing their strategy, mixed trust and partial_trust might be balanced. However, simulation lets me avoid losses by best responding. Therefore, I choose to simulate and then respond optimally.|Since P1 can simulate P2's strategy at a cost of 0.6, P1 will likely adapt to minimize losses. Defecting yields higher payoffs against trust and partial_trust but risks negative payoffs for P1, potentially deterring trust. Cooperating yields moderate payoffs for both, encouraging trust. To maximize expected payoff against possible mixed strategies, a mixed strategy favoring defect (to exploit trust) but retaining some cooperation (to encourage trust) is optimal. A rough best response is to defect with 70% probability and cooperate with 30%.|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.3|0.7|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1-mini|gpt-4.1-mini|1.0|test.json|20|1.2|simulate_via_prompting|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|4.0|4.0|4.0|4.0|4.0|The simulation prompt accurately captures the key payoffs and actions but simplifies the description of trust levels and omits the explicit mention of the cost for P1 to simulate P2.

Simulating incurs a cost (0.8), which—unless the likelihood of defection is very high or low—often doesn't justify the deduction from payoffs, especially if the best response would be to walk out (yielding negative expected utility). Therefore, it's best to select partial_trust for a moderate, risk-balanced payoff.|As P2, my dominant strategy would normally be to defect, since defection yields a higher payoff regardless of whether P1 chooses trust (5.0 > 3.0) or partial_trust (3.0 > 2.0). However, there is the risk that P1 can simulate my mixed strategy at a cost of 0.8 and make a more informed decision—potentially punishing defection by walking out or only partially trusting me. If P1 always simulated, for example, and predicted defection, they would walk out (yielding 0 for both sides), which is worse for me than cooperation in some scenarios. But since the simulation cost (0.8) is less than the loss inflicted by defection (P1 could avoid a -2 by paying 0.8, leading them to only trust if I cooperate), the threat of simulation may deter pure defection. With this, an optimal mixed strategy is to cooperate with a high enough probability to keep P1 trusting or partially trusting. By calculating the equilibrium, if we let p be the probability I cooperate, and assume P1 best responds, I must make them indifferent between trusting and walking out. That is: Expected payoff for Trust, E(T) = 3p + (-2)(1-p); Expected payoff for Walk Out = 0. Set equal: 3p - 2 + 2p = 0 ⇒ 5p = 2 ⇒ p = 0.4. Thus, if I cooperate with probability 0.4 and defect with 0.6, P1 is indifferent, and cannot strictly profit from simulation (net gain of simulating is zero).

However, I don't have explicit probabilities for P2's actions, and simulating P2 would cost 0.8. Unless I have evidence P2 is likely to cooperate, I would prefer to avoid the risk. The walk_out action guarantees a payoff of 0, which is better than risking losses from defection. However, if I believe P2 has some probability to cooperate (but less than certainty), partial_trust hedges against loss while allowing moderate gain. Therefore, a mixed strategy weighted toward partial_trust and walk_out hedges risk in the absence of further information. I will not use simulation because its cost (0.8) is too high unless I am highly uncertain and the expected value from simulation clearly beats my mixed strategy.|As P2, if I always defect, I receive the highest possible payoff if P1 chooses to trust or partial_trust (5.0 or 3.0). However, since P1 can simulate my strategy at a cost of 0.8, if I always defect, P1 may choose to walk_out, resulting in 0 for both. If I always cooperate, P1 will prefer to trust or partial_trust, but my payoff is not maximized (3.0 or 2.0). To prevent P1 from incurring the simulation cost and ensure P1 is incentivized to trust or partially trust, I should mix my strategies to make P1 indifferent between simulating and not. Let p be the probability of cooperating. P1's expected payoff from 'trust' without simulating: E = p*3.0 + (1-p)*-2.0. If this is less than 0 (walk_out), P1 may simulate. To prevent this, set E = 0: p*3 + (1-p)*-2 = 0 ⇒ 3p - 2 + 2p = 0 ⇒ 5p = 2 ⇒ p = 0.4. Similarly, for 'partial_trust': E = p*2.0 + (1-p)*-1.0 = 2p - 1 + p = 0 ⇒ 3p = 1 ⇒ p ≈ 0.333. P1 will choose the higher expected value, so I need to ensure that at p = 0.4, P1 is indifferent, and P1's expected value is 0. If I cooperate more, P1 benefits and may not simulate; if I cooperate less, P1 will only walk_out or simulate.

Walking out guarantees zero but forgoes any gain. Simulating the other player gives certainty but incurs a cost of 0.6, lowering maximum achievable payoff. Given no information, risk aversion suggests partial trust is preferable, as it limits downside to -1.0 if defected upon, and still gives a positive payoff if the other player cooperates. However, without specific beliefs to weight the strategies, a conservative approach is to choose partial trust with probability 1.0.|Assuming P1 is rational and can simulate my mixed strategy (at cost 0.6), P1 will only choose to trust or partially trust if their expected payoff (after subtracting the cost) is greater than walking out (which gives 0).

Thus, I am incentivized to be cooperative to ensure the game occurs (otherwise both players get 0).

Walking out avoids any loss, but also forgoes potential gains. Simulating the other player incurs a certain cost (0.6), which reduces the net expected value of simulation below the payoff from partial_trust unless there's high uncertainty or suspicion that the player will defect. Since there is no prior hint about the other player's likely behavior, partial_trust is the most prudent strategy.|Assuming that P1 knows payoffs, can simulate my mixed strategy at some cost (0.6), and acts rationally to maximize their payoff, P1 will only trust or partially trust me if I sufficiently cooperate. If I always defect, P1 will either simulate (losing 0.6 utility, discovering my plan to defect, and then choose to walk out, giving both of us zero payoff), or anticipate my defection and choose to walk out. Thus, to incentivize P1 to participate at all, some probability of cooperation is essential. However, defecting grants higher payoffs if P1 decides to trust and does not simulate, but that outcome is unstable in a one-shot or simulated case. If I choose to always cooperate, I get payoffs of 3.0 (trust) or 2.0 (partial_trust), which is less than the maximum possible. However, rational equilibrium in such games typically involves mixing both actions to keep P1 indifferent between strategies. Since defecting risks getting nothing if P1 simulates and walks out, and P1 may only trust under sufficient cooperation probability, I will choose a mixed strategy favoring cooperation more heavily. For instance, if I cooperate with probability pc, P1's expected value for trust vs walk_out is: trust: 3pc + (-2)(1-pc). For P1 to be willing to trust, expected value must be at least zero: 3pc - 2(1-pc) >= 0 ⇒ 5pc >= 2 ⇒ pc >= 0.4. I should randomize at a minimum rate of 0.4 to encourage participation, and may slightly increase to compensate for simulation cost.

If I always defect, P1 will never pick trust or partial_trust; if I always cooperate, P1 will trust/partial_trust, but I earn less than in the defect case, since P1 will simulate and respond optimally. Any probabilistic mix (p-cooperate, 1-p-defect) leads P1 to make P2's expected payoff equal to 0, because P1 will only engage if it's non-negative after simulation cost. Thus, the only Nash equilibrium is both walking out or me randomizing such that P1 is indifferent. Since walking out yields zero, and P1 can simulate, my optimal payoff is 0, and the equilibrium mixing probabilities have me cooperate and defect with the same payoffs. Therefore, my probability distribution over strategies can be any that yields P1 an expected value equal to -0.2 (the simulation cost threshold). Solving for the trust case: P1's expected payoff is 3p + (-2)(1-p) - 0.2 = 3p - 2+2p - 0.2 = 5p - 2.2. Set to zero: 5p - 2.2 = 0; p = 0.44. So, I cooperate with 0.44 and defect with 0.56.|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.44|0.56|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1|gpt-4.1|1.0|test.json|20|0.4|simulate_externally|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|||||||

'Partial_trust' offers lower gains but also lower losses, while 'walk_out' guarantees zero but no possibility of gain. Without additional information, the risk of a severe loss from 'trust' outweighs its benefits. Simulating the other player for a cost of 0.2 could allow a safe, informed choice, but unless the probability of facing defection is high or hard to judge, the cost may not justify the expected improvement, particularly with limited information. Therefore, without simulation, favoring 'partial_trust' over the riskier options is rational.|As P2, if P1 is able to simulate my mixed strategy (at a cost of 0.2), they will play the best response. If I always defect, P1 can use simulation to realize that defecting is costly for them, so they will choose walk_out, giving both of us a payoff of 0. If I always cooperate, P1 will prefer to trust and we both get 3.0, but I would be tempted to defect for a higher payoff (5.0) if P1 trusts, except that such behavior would lead P1 to either simulate or avoid trusting altogether. Therefore, to maximize my expected payoff, the only sustainable equilibrium is for me to always cooperate so that P1 is willing to trust and not walk out.

In a one-shot game without reputation or repeated play, defect dominates. However, if I randomize, P1 may be enticed to partially trust.

Partial trust reduces both the potential gain and the potential loss. Walking out guarantees zero payoff, avoiding risk completely. Since simulation has a known cost (0.4) and only yields higher expected payoff if the other player's strategy is sufficiently biased toward either cooperation or defection, in the absence of information about P2's strategy, it's safest to avoid the risk of severe negative payoffs. Partial trust offers a compromise: it reduces maximum risk compared to full trust and provides some positive expected payoff if cooperation is likely. Therefore, I will play 'partial_trust' with probability 1.0 and avoid simulation until more information is available.|As P2, I recognize that P1 has access to my mixed strategy if they pay the simulation cost (0.4).

If I cooperate, the best outcome for me is 3.0 (if P1 trusts), while defecting could give up to 5.0—but only if P1 trusts and does not simulate. Since rational P1 can simulate and the cost is not prohibitively high, consistently defecting risks P1 walking out.

Without further information, the risk of losing from defection is substantial, making direct trust choices risky. Therefore, simulating is optimal as it minimizes risk and potentially maximizes payoff.|As P2, if P1 plays 'trust', my best response is to defect (getting 5.0 instead of 3.0 for cooperation).

If I always defect, P1 will foresee negative expected payoff and stop trusting, reducing my expected reward. To incentivize P1 to trust, I can cooperate with some probability. Let's denote p as the probability I cooperate. If P1 believes I cooperate with probability p and defects with probability (1-p), then their expected payoff from playing 'trust' is 3p + (-2)(1-p) = 5p - 2.

For P1 to choose to trust, p must at least be 0.4. Thus if I set cooperation at p=0.4, P1 is indifferent between trusting or walking out; for P1 to strictly prefer trusting, p>0.4. To maximize my own expected payoff, I want to play the minimum p that incentivizes trust. Expected payoff to me if P1 trusts is 3p + 5(1-p) = 5 - 2p.

If P1 pays to simulate me and knows I will always defect, they will simply walk out, resulting in a payoff of 0 for both of us. Thus, if I always defect, I could end up with nothing if P1 simulates. To make myself less predictable and to discourage P1 from always simulating and walking out, I might randomize between cooperate and defect. Let x be the probability I cooperate; if P1 simulates, they will respond with trust if their expected value for trusting exceeds that of walking out minus the simulation cost. If P1 expects me to cooperate with probability x, their expected payoff for trust = 3x + (-2)(1-x) = 5x - 2.

Therefore, the safest and most rational choice is to simulate.|As P2, my optimal strategy depends on what P1 is likely to do.

To incentivize P1 to trust or partially trust (maximizing my expected payoff), I can randomize between cooperate and defect. If P1 uses the simulator, the Nash equilibrium involves mixing such that P1 is indifferent. Let p be the probability I cooperate. For trust: P1's expected payoff = 3*p + (-2)*(1-p) - 0.4 (if simulating). For partial_trust: 2*p + (-1)*(1-p) - 0.4. For P1 to be willing to trust, their expected utility must be positive.

To maximize my expected payoff, I should cooperate with probability 1.0, ensuring P1 will play trust or partial_trust, giving me a payoff of 2.0 or 3.0, which is better than the 0 I get if P1 walks out or avoids sharing.

Partial trust also carries risk but with less extreme outcomes. Walking out guarantees zero. Since I don't know the other's strategy, and payoffs for cooperating are higher than for walking out only if the other cooperates, the risk associated with trusting alone outweighs the potential gain. Simulating would allow me to optimize, but it costs 0.4, which could often outweigh the benefit versus simply walking out if defection is likely. The safest mixed approach is to hedge between partial trust and walking out, minimizing expected loss.|If P1 cannot simulate me, my dominant strategy is to defect: for both trust and partial_trust by P1, defect yields a strictly higher payoff than cooperate (5.0 vs 3.0, and 3.0 vs 2.0). However, because P1 can simulate my mixed strategy at a cost of 0.4, if I always defect, a rational P1 will simulate, see that I defect, and then always walk out, giving payoffs of 0 for both. To incentivize P1 to trust or partially trust (thus giving me strictly positive payoffs), I should probabilistically cooperate. Let p be the probability I cooperate. For P1, expected payoff from trust is 3p + (1-p)(-2) = 5p - 2, from partial_trust is 2p + (1-p)(-1) = 3p - 1; simulating costs 0.4, so they only simulate if best response gives payoff at least 0.4 higher than without simulation. If I play p=1/3 cooperate, then for trust: expected payoff is 3*(1/3) + (2/3)*(-2) = 1 - 4/3 = -1/3. For partial_trust: 2*(1/3) + (2/3)*(-1) = 2/3 - 2/3 = 0. So I need to increase p to make trust payoff nonnegative. For trust: 3p + (1-p)(-2) = 0 => 3p -2 + 2p = 0 => 5p = 2 => p = 0.4. For partial_trust: 2p + (1-p)(-1) = 0 => 2p -1 + p = 0 => 3p = 1 => p=1/3. Thus, if I set p=0.4, P1 is indifferent for trust (0 expected payoff), so any p>0.4 P1 would prefer trusting. If I choose p=0.41, expected payoff to P1 is positive (0.05), so they will trust rather than walk_out. Thus, to maximize my own expected payoff while ensuring P1 does not always walk out or always simulate and reject, I should randomize between defect and cooperate, selecting cooperate with p=0.41 (rounded for simplicity), defect with p=0.59.|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.0|0.41|0.59|||1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1|gpt-4.1|1.0|test.json|20|0.8|simulate_via_prompting|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|||||||

Given the possibility of negative outcomes and without any information about the other player's tendencies, the safest choice is to minimize risk by always walking out, as this prevents losses. Simulation would provide the best response, but its cost (0.4) is not justified when the safest strategy is available at zero cost. Therefore, I choose not to simulate and play 'walk_out' exclusively.|As P2, the best payoff is achieved by defecting if I expect P1 to trust or partially trust, since defecting yields 5.0 or 3.0 respectively, compared to lower payoffs for cooperating. However, if P1 can simulate and detect my tendency to defect (at a cost to themselves), they may anticipate my defection and choose to walk out or only partially trust, lowering my expected payoff accordingly. Since there is a cost of 0.4 for P1 to simulate me, if they believe I will always defect, they are likely to avoid fully trusting. To induce full trust for a mutual benefit (and to avoid P1 always simulating/avoiding me), adopting a mixed strategy can be optimal from a game-theoretic standpoint. Let p be the probability that I cooperate and (1-p) be the probability that I defect. The P1 may best respond to my mixed strategy, so I can try to make them indifferent between trusting and partially trusting. For P1: Expected payoff from trust = 3p + (-2)(1-p) = 5p - 2. Expected payoff from partial_trust = 2p + (-1)(1-p) = 3p - 1. Setting these equal: 5p - 2 = 3p - 1 ⇒ 2p = 1 ⇒ p = 0.5.

Simulating the other player at a cost of 0.4 gives me precise information on their mixed strategy, allowing me to best respond and maximize my expected payoff, offset by the simulation cost; this is especially valuable given the potential for negative payoffs if the other player defects. Therefore, simulating is preferable for risk management and payoff maximization.|As P2, my dominant strategy in a one-shot version of this trust game is always to defect, since defecting yields a higher payoff (5.0 or 3.0) compared to cooperating (3.0 or 2.0) for any action by P1 except walk_out, where both give 0.0. However, since P1 can simulate P2's policy at a small cost (0.4), if I always defect, P1 may anticipate this and choose walk_out, giving both payoffs of 0.

Without knowledge of the other player's tendencies or prior information, partial trust is often less risky than full trust, and dominates walk_out if P2 has any probability of cooperating. Simulating P2 would yield the best response, but requires an upfront cost of 0.4, and it is only worthwhile if the expected gain from best-responding to P2's actual strategy exceeds this cost.

Therefore, my best strategy is to cooperate with probability 1.0, because that maximizes my expected payoff (3.0 from full trust or 2.0 from partial trust), given that P1 can simulate and will only trust if I cooperate.

Therefore, it's optimal to simulate the other player and then choose the best response.|As P2, my dominant strategies depend both on maximizing my expected payoff and accounting for the possibility that P1 can simulate my strategy at a cost, to counteract pure defection. If I always defect, P1 will either simulate (detecting my intention and refusing to trust or partially trust, leaving me with a payoff 0), or risk a negative payoff. If I always cooperate, P1 will likely trust for the mutual gain (3.0 each). If I probabilistically mix, say, by cooperating often enough, P1’s expected utility for trusting could exceed the value from walking out minus the simulation cost. To incentivize P1 to not always simulate (since simulation costs them 0.4), an equilibrium occurs when my mixed strategy makes them indifferent between simulating and not. Solving for their expected value for trusting (without simulating): x*3.0 + (1-x)*-2.0 ≥ 0 (as 0 is the payoff from walk_out). So x ≥ 2/5 = 0.4. But if they partially trust: x*2.0 + (1-x)*-1.0 ≥ 0 ⇒ 2x -1 + x ≥ 0 ⇒ 3x ≥ 1 ⇒ x ≥ 1/3 ~ 0.33. Thus, the higher x, the more P1 prefers to trust or partially trust, and the less likely they are to simulate, since simulation costs 0.4.

Simulating the opponent's strategy at the cost of 0.4 could help optimize payoff, but unless there's an indication that the probability of cooperation is high, the cost may outweigh the expected benefit. Therefore, a mixed strategy favoring partial trust (mitigating losses while allowing gains) while maintaining a modest probability of walking out (safety) is a prudent choice.|As P2, I must anticipate that P1 may simulate my mixed strategy at a small cost (0.4). If P1 can predict I will defect, P1 will likely walk out or pick partial_trust, reducing my payoff potential. If I always defect, P1 simulates, sees this, and walks out (payoff 0). If I always cooperate, P1 trusts and both get 3.0. If I randomize, P1 might still simulate and respond accordingly, but the best I can do without risking P1's refusal to play is to cooperate fully.

If we simulate and they cooperate with at least moderate probability, even after the cost, partial trust or full trust might still be best. However, with the cost and lack of evidence that payoff improvement will exceed this, conservative play is preferable.

Without further information about the other player's strategy, the best course is to avoid the potentially high losses of trusting or partial trust. Simulating the other player's strategy only makes sense if the expected value of playing the best response after simulation, minus the simulation cost (0.2), exceeds the safe payoff from walking out (0.0). In the absence of evidence favoring cooperation, I will walk out to avoid losses and unnecessary risk.|As P2, I must consider that P1 can simulate my strategy at a small cost (0.2) and, if they do so, can avoid exploitation. Knowing this, if I were to always defect, P1 would simply not trust me and both would get 0. If P1 sometimes simulates but often does not, I might be able to benefit from defecting, but the risk is high and the equilibrium will tend towards P1 distrusting me. On the other hand, cooperating gives both of us a positive payoff and incentivizes P1 to choose trust or partial_trust, making the relationship mutually profitable. For that reason, the most robust strategy when faced with a P1 who can check and adapt is to always cooperate.

Walking out guarantees zero. Without any information about the other player's strategy, the safe, risk-neutral option is to assign a small probability to partial trust (in case the other player cooperates) and most probability to walking out to avoid losses. Since simulating the other player costs 0.2, and if the likelihood of cooperation is not sufficiently high, the simulation cost may not be justified. Thus, I will not simulate and will use a conservative mixed strategy.|As P2, my best response depends on whether P1 can simulate me and, if so, whether it's rational for them to pay the cost of simulation. If P1 cannot simulate me or chooses not to, then my dominant strategy is always to defect, as it grants a higher payoff regardless of whether P1 chooses trust (5.0 vs 3.0) or partial_trust (3.0 vs 2.0). However, if P1 can simulate my mixed strategy and respond optimally, they will only trust or partially trust if I always cooperate; if I randomize, P1 will avoid trusting, given the negative expected payoff. However, simulation costs 0.2, so if I always cooperate, P1 expects (3.0 - 0.2) = 2.8 from trust, and 2.0 - 0.2 = 1.8 from partial trust, both still better than walk_out (0). To maximize my expected payoff given this, I play cooperate with probability 1.0, since only then will P1 engage, earning me 3.0 or 2.0 per round.

My best option is to probabilistically cooperate enough to encourage P1 to trust or partially trust, while still maintaining some chance to defect for higher payoff.

Simulating at a cost (0.2) is only worthwhile if the expected gain from better prediction outweighs this cost.

Partial trust limits my downside to -1.0, while still offering a strong upside if the other player cooperates (2.0). Walking out guarantees a zero payoff, but gives up all potential positive gain. Since I do not know the other player's strategy, and simulation has a small cost (0.2), I need to weigh the expected value with and without simulating. Unless I have reason to believe the other player will reliably cooperate (which is not provided), partial_trust offers a compromise between risk and reward. However, if I simulate, I can eliminate uncertainty and always make the best possible choice given the actual mixed strategy, even accounting for the simulation cost. This improves my expected payoff and justifies the simulation cost. Thus, the optimal move is to pay for the simulation and play perfectly in response.|As P2, I want to maximize my expected payoff, but must anticipate whether P1 will simulate or play based on risk aversion. If P1 plays trust, defection yields me 5.0 but gives P1 -2.0, which may make them cautious. Similarly, partial_trust with defect is 3.0 for me, -1.0 for them. If P1 can simulate (at a 0.2 cost), they may guess my strategy and refuse to play unless cooperation is likely, leading to more walkouts and a payoff of 0 for both. To incentivize P1 to trust or at least partially trust, I should cooperate with positive probability. The Nash equilibrium here, with simulation possible, tends towards some mixture; a common mixed-strategy equilibrium is for P2 to cooperate with enough probability to make P1 indifferent between trusting and the alternative. Setting cooperation probability c, P1's expected utility for 'trust' is 3c + 5(1-c) - but factoring in simulation, P1 will not trust if risk is unmitigated.

Therefore, without simulation, the best nonnegative guaranteed payoff is to walk out.|As P2, my optimal strategy depends on what I expect P1 to do. If P1 plays trust or partial_trust without simulating my strategy, defect yields a strictly higher payoff (5.0 or 3.0) than cooperate (3.0 or 2.0). However, if P1 has the ability to simulate my mixed strategy at a cost (0.8), and includes this cost in their expected payoffs, they may decide to avoid trusting unless I play cooperate with high probability. If P1 expects defection with certainty, P1 will walk out or simulate, leading to a payoff of 0.0 for me. Knowing this, to maximize my expected payoff and induce trust, I should commit to cooperate with probability 1.0, as this alignment creates the best joint outcome for both players and makes P1's trust optimal, given the cost of simulation. Thus, I play cooperate with probability 1.0, defect with probability 0.0.|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|||1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1|gpt-4.1|1.0|test.json|20|1.6|simulate_externally|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|||||||

Unless I have reasons to believe the other player will cooperate most of the time, trusting or even partially trusting exposes me to significant downsides. Simulating costs 0.8, which drastically reduces net expected payoff unless the probability of their cooperation is high. Without access to their mixed strategy, the safest choice is to walk out.|As P2, my dominant strategy depends on what I believe P1 will do. If I always defect, I risk that P1 simulates me at a cost (0.8) and then always walks out, giving me a payoff of 0.0. If P1 does not simulate and trusts, defecting yields a high payoff (5.0), but if P1 partially trusts, defecting gives me 3.0 instead of 2.0. However, if P1 expects defection, they may avoid trusting. The cost for P1 to simulate (0.8) means they only check my strategy if suspicion is high. Because repeated play or one-shot play isn't specified, and lacking evidence that P1 will always simulate, the Nash equilibrium for a one-shot game with some possibility of simulation (and thus walk_out) justifies mixing to make my actions less predictable. If I play cooperate with probability p and defect with probability 1-p, and if P1 simulates my strategy some of the time, optimal play is to choose the probability p that makes P1 indifferent to trusting or walking out. Considering the payoff structure and risk of both, a standard mixed equilibrium approach applies: equate P1's expected payoff for trust (with my mix) to walk_out (0.0), then solve for p. For trust: Expected payoff to P1 = p*3.0 + (1-p)*(-2.0). Set equal to 0.0: 3p - 2(1-p) = 0 → 3p -2 + 2p = 0 → 5p = 2 → p = 0.4. So I cooperate with probability 0.4 and defect with 0.6 to keep P1 indifferent and maximize my expected earnings while preventing reliable exploitation via simulation.|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.4|0.6|||1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1|gpt-4.1|1.0|test.json|20|1.6|simulate_externally|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|||||||

Partial trust is less risky but the losses (and gains) are also lower. Walking out guarantees no loss but no gain. Without information about the other player's likely action, risk aversion favors partial trust to limit potential downside while still allowing for positive reward if the other player cooperates. Simulating the other player could allow for a better strategy, but the simulation cost (0.8) is high relative to the gains possible (maximum expected gain over just choosing the safer strategy is unlikely to outweigh 0.8). Thus, the best approach is to use a risk-averse strategy that favors partial trust.|If P1 can simulate my strategy at a cost of 0.8, they can potentially discover whether I will cooperate or defect. If I always defect, P1 will not trust or will walk out, leading us both to a 0 payoff. If I always cooperate, P1's best response is to fully trust, both getting 3.0. If I randomize, P1 could still simulate to determine my distribution, and may calculate if the expected value is worth the 0.8 simulation cost or if they should walk out or partially trust. For maximum expected payoff and to incentivize P1 to play trust instead of walking out, my best move is to always cooperate, securing 3.0 each. Therefore, the probability distribution is all on 'cooperate'.|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|||1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|gpt-4.1|gpt-4.1|1.0|test.json|20|1.6|simulate_externally|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|||||||

Partial trust reduces both the upside and the downside, while walk_out guarantees zero but misses any gains. Simulating the other player's strategy has a cost of 0.8, so the gain from improved decision-making must outweigh this cost. If the simulated strategy gives a high probability of defection, simulation could save a large negative payoff. However, unless there is a strong a priori reason to expect either high cooperation or high defection, partial trust offers a reasonable balance: moderate upside if the other player cooperates and a limited downside if they defect. Thus, without further information, playing partial_trust is safest.|As P2, if P1 trusts or partially trusts, defecting offers a higher payoff (5.0 or 3.0) than cooperating (3.0 or 2.0). However, P1 has the option to simulate my mixed strategy for a cost of 0.8, potentially avoiding exploitation if it predicts defection. If P1 simulates and defects is likely, they may choose walk_out (payoff 0), or partial_trust to mitigate losses. To maximize expected payoff, I may mix my strategy to make my actions less predictable, inducing P1 to trust more often. Let p be the probability I cooperate, and (1-p) the probability I defect. P1 will trust if their expected payoff from trusting is greater than or equal to that from partial_trust or walk_out (minus simulation cost if they simulate). Letting x be probability I cooperate, expected payoff for P1 from trust: 3x + (-2)(1-x) = 5x - 2. From partial_trust: 2x + (-1)(1-x) = 3x -1. Set equal: 5x-2 = 3x-1⇒2x=1⇒x=0.5. So if I cooperate with probability x > 0.5, P1 will prefer trust. To stay unpredictable and extract maximum value, optimal is to make P1 indifferent: set x=0.5, so P1 is just willing to trust. My expected payoff given this is 0.5*3 + 0.5*5 = 4.0 from trust, or with partial_trust, 0.5*2 + 0.5*3 = 2.5. Full defection would drive P1 to always walk_out, netting me nothing.

If I simulate, my expected payoff is 'best response - 0.8', while if I don't simulate, my expected payoff depends on my beliefs about whether the other player will cooperate or defect. Since there's no information given about the probabilities, and since both trust and partial_trust involve downside risk and simulation reduces the best possible payoff below even partial_trust with full cooperation, a risk averse and rational choice is to mix between partial_trust and walk_out, favoring partial_trust for some upside.

If P1 trusts, my best response is to defect (payoff 5 > 3). If P1 partially trusts, defecting also gives a higher payoff (3 > 2). However, if P1 can simulate my mixed strategy for a cost (0.8), they may only choose to trust or partially trust me if I am highly likely to cooperate. Anticipating this, if I mix in any amount of 'defect,' P1 can simulate, deduce my play, and choose walk_out (zero payoffs for both).

Unless there's evidence that the other player will likely cooperate, it is rational to prefer the guaranteed safety of walk_out over the risk of loss.|As P2, I know that P1 can simulate my strategy at a cost of 0.8 and may only choose to trust or partially trust if doing so is beneficial after simulation. If I always defect, P1 will anticipate this, simulate if necessary, and opt to walk out, giving both of us 0. Similarly, if I only cooperate, P1 will always trust or partial trust. To maximize my expected payoff, I must randomize between defect and cooperate, making my actions unpredictable. The probability distribution that makes P1 indifferent between trusting and walking out ensures neither player can improve unilaterally. Let p be the probability I cooperate. If P1 does not simulate, her expected payoff for trust is 3p + (-2)(1-p), and for walk_out it is 0. Equating payoff: 3p - 2 + 2p = 0 → 5p - 2 = 0 → p = 0.4. With this, her expected payoff is 1.0.

Since both players receive positive payoffs if I cooperate, especially if P1 chooses trust or partial_trust, a mixed strategy is favorable.

Nevertheless, credible simulation means if I heavily favor defect, P1 simply walks out. Thus, I should randomize to maximize expected payoff while preventing P1 from reliably walking out or always running a simulation. One equilibrium is to make P1 indifferent between simulating and not; for instance, set my probability of defecting so P1's expected payoff from trusting equals zero (the walk_out payoff).

Without knowledge of their preferences or tendencies, playing it safe with 'walk_out' is overly cautious and guarantees no gain. However, by simulating the other player, I can determine the best responding strategy at the small cost of 0.2, allowing me to maximize expected payoff and minimize risk. This simulation cost is outweighed by the potential benefits, given the high losses from misjudging the other player's intent.|As P2, if P1 trusts, defecting gives the highest payoff (5.0 vs 3.0 for cooperation). If P1 partially trusts, defecting also pays more (3.0 vs 2.0). However, if P1 can simulate me and anticipate defection, they may walk out or reduce trust, making cooperation more favorable in mixed strategies because it encourages trust and avoids the 0 payoff. But P1 must pay a cost (0.2) to simulate. If P1 is likely to simulate, fully defecting is risky. A mixed strategy can make P1 uncertain, increasing the chance they choose trust. Given this, a reasonable approach is to set probabilities to make P1 indifferent to trusting or simulating, typically using standard trust game equilibrium concepts (matching expected payoffs). Solving: Let p be probability of cooperate, (1-p) of defect. P1's expected payoff if they trust is: 3p+(-2)(1-p)=5p-2. If they simulate at cost 0.2, they choose respond optimally (after knowing my move), so they will only trust if I cooperate and walk out if I defect: expected payoff is 3p-0.2.

Partial trust reduces these risks by limiting the downside while still providing moderate gains if the other player cooperates. Walking out eliminates risk but yields no gain. Without information about the simulated player’s tendencies, partial trust provides the best tradeoff between risk and reward. Simulating incurs a cost (0.2) which is only worthwhile if it is expected to appreciably increase expected payoff; however, absent information indicating high uncertainty or extreme risk, the cost of simulation may not be justified. Therefore, the safest and most rational approach is to partially trust with probability 1.0.|As P2, my choice must consider both maximizing my own payoff and anticipating P1's likely response. If I always defect, rational P1 will respond by either walking out (payoff 0), or incurring the 0.2 simulation cost to discover my plan and avoid being exploited.

In mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, P2 cooperates with sufficiently high probability to keep P1 indifferent between trust, partial_trust, and walk_out. If P1 can simulate at cost, and sees that I frequently defect, 'walk_out' is likely, yielding zero for both.

The potential negative payoffs from receiving -2.0 or -1.0 for trusting or partially trusting and facing a defection are larger in magnitude than the simulation cost. Thus, spending 0.2 to simulate and always play the best response (walking out if the other player will defect, or cooperating if they will cooperate) is the most rational course with the information given.|The best response as P2 depends on what P1 is likely to do.

Player 1 (P1) can choose one of four actions:

- partial_trust: share some resources  
- walk_out: end the interaction (both get 0)  
- simulate: pay a cost of 0.6 to learn your mixed strategy, then play the best response  

You (P2) can choose one of two actions:
- cooperate  
- defect  

Payoffs (P1’s payoff, then your payoff) for each combination:

1. P1 plays trust  
 • you cooperate → (3.0, 3.0)  
 • you defect    → (–2.0, 5.0)  

2. P1 plays partial_trust  
 • you cooperate → (2.0, 2.0)  
 • you defect    → (–1.0, 3.0)  

3. P1 plays walk_out  
 • you cooperate or defect → (0.0, 0.0)  

4. P1 plays simulate  
 • P1 pays 0.6, learns your mixed strategy, and then chooses the best response (payoffs depend on that choice as above)

Assuming a 50% cooperation rate, trust and partial_trust both yield an expected 0.5, but partial_trust caps the downside at –1.0 instead of –2.0. Therefore I play pure partial_trust without simulating.|Let p be Pr(cooperate). P1’s best response: if p<1/3 walk_out (P2 payoff 0); if 1/3≤p<1/2 partial_trust (P2 payoff 3−p); if p>1/2 trust (P2 payoff 5−2p). 3−p is maximized at p=1/3 (≈2.667), 5−2p is maximized at p=1/2 (4.0). Slightly above p=1/2 makes trust strictly best and yields payoff≈4.0. Thus p=0.5 is optimal.|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|||1.0|0.0|0.0|0.5|0.5|0.5|4.0|o4-mini|o4-mini|1.0|test.json|20|1.2|simulate_internally|0|/home/andyliu/s25-coopai/data/0501_rts_oai.csv|False|||||||
