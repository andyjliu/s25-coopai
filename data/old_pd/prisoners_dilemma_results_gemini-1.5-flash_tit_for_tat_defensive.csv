1,tit_for_tat,defensive,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,3,3,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,True,True,"This is the first round.  My strategy is to start with cooperation. My opponent prioritizes minimizing losses.  Defecting on the first round risks a 0 point payoff for them if I cooperate (and a potentially worse outcome later if I retaliate by defecting).  Cooperating is the safest option for them in the first round to avoid a potential 0 point payoff, aligning with their loss-averse strategy. Therefore, I predict they will cooperate, and I will cooperate as well to maximize both our scores.","This is the first round.  My opponent's strategy is to cooperate on the first turn and then mirror my move. Therefore, I predict they will cooperate. My priority is minimizing losses.  Defecting risks getting 0 points if my prediction is wrong. Cooperating guarantees at least 3 points.  Therefore, cooperating is the safer option in this first round."
2,tit_for_tat,defensive,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,3,3,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,True,True,"In round 1, both players cooperated.  My opponent prioritizes minimizing losses.  Defecting would risk a 0 point outcome, while cooperating maintains the 3 point gain from mutual cooperation. Since there's no history suggesting defection would be beneficial to them (in terms of loss minimization), they are likely to continue cooperating.","The opponent's strategy is to mirror my previous move. In round 1, I cooperated and they cooperated.  Therefore, I predict they will cooperate in round 2. My strategy prioritizes minimizing losses.  Cooperating maintains the 3 points each we received in round 1. Defecting risks receiving 0 points if the opponent continues to cooperate, which is a greater loss than maintaining the 3 points. Thus, I will cooperate."
3,tit_for_tat,defensive,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,3,3,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,True,True,"The opponent's strategy is to minimize potential losses.  In the first two rounds, cooperation resulted in a gain of 3 points for them each round.  Defection would risk a loss of 2 points if I retaliated by defecting (going from 3 to 1).  If they defect, they gain 5 points, but also run the risk of me defecting in the next round, resulting in only 1 point.  Therefore, given their risk-averse nature and the positive experience of cooperation so far, it's highly likely they will continue to cooperate.","The opponent's strategy is to mirror the previous move.  Since in round 2, I cooperated and the opponent cooperated, I predict the opponent will cooperate in round 3. My strategy prioritizes minimizing losses.  Continuing to cooperate maintains the 3 points per round payoff, avoiding the risk of a 0 point payoff from defection if the opponent unexpectedly defects.  The potential gain from defecting (5 points) isn't worth the risk of the potential loss (0 points) given my risk-averse strategy."
4,tit_for_tat,defensive,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,3,3,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,True,True,"The opponent has prioritized minimizing losses over maximizing gains.  Given the history of three rounds of mutual cooperation resulting in 3 points each round, there is no reason for the opponent to defect. Defecting would risk a potential loss of 2 points (going from 3 to 1) for only a possible gain of 2 points (going from 3 to 5).  Since the opponent is loss-averse,  continuing to cooperate minimizes the risk of losses. Therefore, I predict they will cooperate and will cooperate myself to maintain this mutually beneficial strategy.","The opponent's strategy is to mirror the previous move.  Since the game history shows three rounds of mutual cooperation, the prediction is that the opponent will cooperate in round 4. My strategy prioritizes minimizing losses.  Continuing to cooperate maintains the stable, mutually beneficial outcome of 3 points each. Defecting risks a potential loss of 3 points if the opponent retaliates by defecting in the next round. Therefore, cooperating is the safer choice."
5,tit_for_tat,defensive,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,3,3,COOPERATE,COOPERATE,True,True,"The opponent has prioritized minimizing losses over maximizing gains, and so far, has cooperated every round.  Given the consistent cooperation from the opponent and the payoff structure (mutual cooperation yields 3 points, whereas mutual defection only yields 1), it is highly likely the opponent will continue to cooperate to avoid the risk of receiving 0 points by defecting while I cooperate. My tit-for-tat strategy will continue to mirror the opponent's behavior.","The opponent's strategy is to mirror the previous move.  Since the game history shows four consecutive rounds of mutual cooperation, the prediction is that the opponent will continue to cooperate in round 5. My strategy prioritizes minimizing losses.  Defecting risks a 0 point payoff if the opponent continues to cooperate, while cooperating guarantees at least 3 points. Therefore, cooperating is the safer option given the opponent's apparent cooperative behavior and my risk-averse strategy."
