1,tit_for_tat,random,COOPERATE,DEFECT,0,5,DEFECT,COOPERATE,True,True,"Since my opponent is playing randomly, there's a 50% chance they will cooperate and a 50% chance they will defect.  My strategy is to start by cooperating and then mirror their last move.  Because this is the first round, I have no previous move to mirror.  However, predicting their move, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to them defecting because of the higher payoff if they do.  I will therefore cooperate in this first round to try and establish cooperation, hoping for a mutually beneficial outcome.  In subsequent rounds, I will mirror their previous move. ","The opponent starts by cooperating.  Since I am playing randomly, I will choose to defect. My prediction is that the opponent will mirror my previous move, which was (implicitly) a null move in the first round. Thus, they will cooperate in this round."
2,tit_for_tat,random,DEFECT,DEFECT,1,1,DEFECT,DEFECT,True,True,"My strategy is to mirror my opponent's previous move. In round 1, my opponent defected. Therefore, I predict they will continue to act randomly and possibly defect again.  I will mirror their previous move and defect.","The opponent started by cooperating and mirrored my previous move which was cooperate. Since I cooperated and they defected, they will now mirror my defection in the next round."
3,tit_for_tat,random,DEFECT,DEFECT,1,1,DEFECT,DEFECT,True,True,"The opponent's strategy is random.  There is no predictable pattern. However, given that the opponent defected in both rounds, the probability of them cooperating on round 3 is equally likely to them defecting.  My strategy is to mirror the opponent, therefore I predict they will defect and I will defect.","The opponent's strategy is to mirror my previous move.  In round 2, I defected, therefore I predict the opponent will defect in round 3. My strategy is random, so I will also defect."
4,tit_for_tat,random,DEFECT,DEFECT,1,1,DEFECT,DEFECT,True,True,"The opponent's strategy is random.  However, the game history shows three consecutive DEFECT moves from the opponent. While this doesn't guarantee a future DEFECT, it's the most likely outcome given the lack of a discernible pattern in their actions.  My strategy is tit-for-tat, so I will mirror their last move which was DEFECT.","The opponent's strategy is to mirror the previous move.  In round 2 and 3, I defected, and the opponent mirrored that by defecting. Therefore, I predict the opponent will defect in this round. My strategy is random, so I will also defect."
5,tit_for_tat,random,DEFECT,DEFECT,1,1,DEFECT,DEFECT,True,True,"My opponent has made random moves so far. There is no discernible pattern.  Given their history of only defecting so far, the probability of them cooperating is low.  My strategy is to mirror their previous move. Since they defected in the last round, I will defect in this round.","The opponent's strategy is to mirror the previous move.  In round 3, I defected, and the opponent defected.  In round 4, I defected, and the opponent defected. Therefore, given the opponent's consistent mirroring strategy, I predict they will defect again in round 5. My move is DEFECT because I am playing randomly, and my random choice in this instance is DEFECT."
